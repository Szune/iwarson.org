Title: Reverse engineering - part 4.1 - full effect

To get the full effect of the rune, we need the "hit" effect as well:

All we have to do is to also send the much simpler 0x83 (131) packet, which has the following structure:
```
U16 length
U8 packet id
U16 target X
U16 target Y
U8 target Z
U8 magic effect id (we send the id subtracted by 1 because the client adds 1 when it parses the packet)
```
