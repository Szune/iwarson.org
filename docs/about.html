            <p>
                2005. The journey started with (what, to young Erik, seemed like) the obvious choice at the time, Visual Basic 6. My mother tried to get me to at the very least learn VB.NET, if not C#. Sadly, I was completely sold on VB6.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started developing tools like <a href="assets/superdesktop.jpg">SuperDesktop</a> (because the solution to a cluttered desktop is to have multiple "desktops"...) and a couple of basic (and some not so basic) cheats for an online game called Tibia.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of those cheats contained a very simple scripting language that I wrote in VB6 (of course), and I've been writing new scripting languages ever since.
            </p>
            <p>
                2008. I released the scripting language as a standalone, it wasn't the huge success I was hoping for. <a href="assets/erzorscript.png">Here</a> is one user on a random forum inadvertently advertising it. <a href="assets/erzorscript2.png">Here</a> is me showing how trustworthy I am while also showing off the capabilities of... "ErZorScript".
            </p>
            <p>
                2009. I had finished writing a functioning forum in PHP, <a href="assets/forum.png">largely</a> <a href="assets/forum2.png">inspired</a> by <a href="assets/forum3.png">vBulletin</a>. It ran on my father's home server for several years before we let it go.
            <p>
                The following years, most of my development time was spent on C# (thanks for the advice, mother, sorry I didn't listen earlier!). Since 2016 I've put more time into learning more programming languages (Go, Kotlin, Python, Dart, C, C++, Rust).
            </p>
            <p>
                My more recent projects are on GitHub, the source code to the previously mentioned projects are long gone. Except (possibly) for the forum, it is unlikely that it would be useful to anyone though.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout my life both my mother (software engineer) and father (system operator) have been a constant source of programming inspiration and encouragement, and I am incredibly thankful for that. I wouldn't be where I am without them.
            </p>
