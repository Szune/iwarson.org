Arguably the most fun part of Tibia was PvP using runes that you had to aim.<br>So this time we're going to take a look at how the client parses projectile packets.<br><br>Before we begin, this is the current state of the server:<br><a href="assets/6/rune-packet-optimized.gif"><img class="img-blog" src="assets/6/rune-packet-optimized.gif"></a><br><br>(I will come back to the parts between the last blog post and this one later on.)<br><br>At this point I have defined a lot of the client's internal packet parser and I happen to know that the client expects packet id 0x85 (133) for projectiles.<br><br>The function looks pretty much as follows (<code class="blog-code">AnimateDistanceProjectile</code> is a lot more involved):<a href="assets/6/parse-projectile-packet.png"><img class="img-blog" src="assets/6/parse-projectile-packet.png"></a><br><br>What was "interesting" this time was that it seemed like the client wouldn't respond to the packet at all, no matter what I sent.<br><br>As it turns out, you have to actually call the <code class="blog-code">Send</code> function in your own code if you want the client to receive it..<br><br>What's even more embarrassing is that I had to debug the client through ollydbg to figure that out.<br>After setting a breakpoint at the starting address of the <code class="blog-code">ParseDistanceProjectilePacket</code> and trying to throw a rune I <i>finally</i> realized that the client never received the packet (and, after a while, why).<br><br>Luckily it was still useful getting used to ollydbg again, because now the client received the packet but didn't do anything after parsing it.<br><br>Time to set a breakpoint again and actually step through the code this time!<br><a href="assets/6/ollydbg.png"><img class="img-blog" src="assets/6/ollydbg.png"></a><br>(picture of ollydbg without the breakpoint toggled, just imagine this but the selected line is redder)<br><br><br>Since I don't know too much assembly, I used Ghidra to follow the addresses in ollydbg.<br><br>Apparently there's an if statement that performs an early return based on the Z coordinate?<br><a href="assets/6/animate-distance-projectile.png"><img class="img-blog" src="assets/6/animate-distance-projectile.png"></a><br><br>Cool, we're getting a better understanding of what's going on and where it's going wrong :-)<br><br>So I take a look at my code again and, for some unknown reason, I added the source pos to the target pos (literally <code class="blog-code">destPos += sourcePos</code>) when I first wrote the function? That can't be right...<br>Let's try removing that, now that we're actually sending the packet.<br><br>Oh.<br>It works now.. The projectile packet is parsed correctly and animates :-D<a href="assets/6/rune-packet-working-optimized.gif"><img class="img-blog" src="assets/6/rune-packet-working-optimized.gif"></a><br><br>I intend to cover more of the early process of figuring out where the packets are parsed and all that in later blog posts.<br><br>Thanks to <a href="https://ezgif.com">ezgif.com</a> the gifs are less than half the original size :-)
