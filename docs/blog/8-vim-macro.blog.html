Having used <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">Vim</a>, <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/">Neovim</a>, <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JaredParMSFT.VsVim">VsVim</a>, <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim">VsCodeVim</a>, vi(m) bindings in terminals and <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/ideavim">IdeaVim (JetBrains)</a>, it's a tool I've really come to enjoy.<br><br>For the most part, I use it because I think it's fun. However, it can often be more ergonomic as well due to requiring fewer keystrokes to perform some tasks.<br>Especially using macros.<br><br>One such case came up today.<br>While working on my app (Norwegian vocabulary helper thing), I had a use for some <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/combine.html">kotlinx.coroutines.flow.combine</a> functions that take more than 5 parameters.<br><br>This is how running the macro ended up looking, generating one implementation as a test and then 5 more:<br><a href="assets/8/vim-macro.gif"><img class="img-blog" src="assets/8/vim-macro.gif"></a><br><br>This can of course be done using other means, it's more to give an idea of what vim is capable of. :-)<br><br>How was it done in Vim? By going to the last line in the file and typing the following:<pre class="blog-pre"><code class="blog-code-block">qe?}&lt;cr&gt;V%0%yGpf&gt;F,byiwea, &lt;esc&gt;p^a$%2kA&lt;esc&gt;Yp^aw^ajf)byiwea, &lt;esc&gt;p^a2jf)byiwea, &lt;esc&gt;p^af{%2kYpkA,&lt;esc&gt;j0^ae^a3j%%2j@e5@e
</code></pre>
<br>What does that mean? Something like:<pre class="blog-pre"><code class="blog-code-block">&lt;cr&gt; = enter, &lt;esc&gt; = escape
<br>qe - start recording a macro in register "e"
?}&lt;cr&gt; - search backwards for "}"
V - start selecting lines
% - jump to matching pair of (), {}, [], etc
0 - go to the start of the line
%
y - yank selection (copy selection to a vim register)
G - go to the last line in the file
p - paste from a vim register
f&gt; - search forwards for "&gt;" on current line
F, - search backwards for "," on current line
b - move back a word
yiw - yank in word (copy current word)
e - move to the end of the current word
a, &lt;esc&gt; - append ", "
p
^a - move to the first number to the right on the current line and increment that number
$ - move to the end of the current line
% - jump to matching pair
2k - move up 2 lines
A&lt;esc&gt; - hit the wrong key by mistake
Y - yank current line
p - paste
^a
w - move forward a word
^a
j - move down a line
f) - search forwards for ")" on current line
b - move back a word
yiw - yank in word 
e - move to the end of the current word
a, &lt;esc&gt; - append ", "
p
^a
2j - move down 2 lines
f) - search forwards for ) on current line
b
yiw
e
a, &lt;esc&gt;
p
^a - increment next number on line
f{ - search forwards for "{" on current line
% - jump to matching pair
2k - move up 2 lines
Y - yank current line
p - paste
k
A,&lt;esc&gt; - append ","
j - move down a line
0 - go to the start of the line
^a
e - move to the end of the current word
^a
3j
% - jump to matching pair for no reason
% - jump back to undo previous mistake
2j - move enough to stop at the end of the new implementation, so that the macro is repeatable
@e - run the macro in register "e" to see if it works
5@e - run the macro 5 more times
</code></pre>
<br>How long did it take to come up with that combination? That's not the point - even if it had been quicker to just write the 6 implementations by hand, it would have been worse for my wrists. And less fun.<br><br>However, having used vim for some years now, this macro was definitely/probably quicker to come up with and type out.<br><br>That's pretty much it, I hope you take this opportunity to try Vim if it seems at all fun or interesting!<br>Or don't, it's really not important. :-)<br><br><b>Other interesting editors:</b><br><ul>
