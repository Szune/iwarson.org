I recently moved from Sweden to Norway, which was quite stressful (I really don't recommend moving during a pandemic!)<br><br>Stress and bureaucracy apparently don't mix well?<br>And so, due to some confusion on my part, my first name was changed from <code class="blog-code">Erik</code> to <code class="blog-code">Carl Erik Patrik</code> during the move (Carl and Patrik originally being my middle names).<br><br>I don't really mind, as I've grown to like it, but it was very odd to be called <code class="blog-code">Carl Erik</code> by a doctor administering covid-19 tests.<br>Because that was the first time in my entire life that anyone had ever called me that.<br><br>Obviously that piqued my interest, so a couple of minutes later I went to the Norwegian tax authority's website and realized what had happened.<br><br>Writing "Carl <i>_Erik</i>_ Patrik" in the first name field on a form had unintended consequences.<br><br>New country, new name, it makes sense.
